            <br>
            After having a lot of experience in SAE during my undergrad, with roles revolving around chassis, I eventually landed my first job as Product Engineer - Chassis Structures for FCA/Stellantis. My role was to design, validate, test and launch structural cradles for all of FCA/Stellantis's brands across the world. A cradle is a structure usually made from sheet metal welded together or a hybrid of aluminum components. This structure bolts directly to the body and interfaces with the suspension links (camber, toe, spring link, etc.), powertrain components (differentials and mounts), stabilzer bar and wiring attachments to name a few. Although majority of what I worked on were stamped steel components, I was also introduced to several manufacturing processes. Below is a breakdown: 
            <br>

            <ul class="bullets"><li class="::marker.sdf"> <u>Hydroforming</u> - a specialized manufacturing process used to shape sheet metal or tubes into complex and intricate forms using high-pressure hydraulic fluid. The process involves placing the metal blank or tube inside a die and then subjecting it to high-pressure hydraulic fluid, which forces the material to conform to the shape of the die. Hydroforming is known for its ability to create parts with high structural integrity, reduced material thinning, and minimal post-processing requirements. It is commonly used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and plumbing.</li>
            
            <li><u>Sheet metal stamping</u> - a manufacturing process where flat sheet metal is formed into various shapes and sizes using a stamping press and dies. The process typically involves cutting, bending, and shaping the metal using a die that consists of a top and bottom component. The sheet metal is placed between the dies, and the press applies force to shape the metal into the desired form. Sheet metal stamping is widely used to produce components for various industries, including automotive, electronics, appliances, and construction. </li>
            
            <li><u>Castings</u> - a manufacturing process where molten metal is poured into a mold cavity to solidify and take the shape of the mold. The mold is typically made of refractory material, and it is designed to have the negative shape of the final product. Once the molten metal cools and solidifies, the mold is removed, and the casting is extracted. Metal castings offer excellent design flexibility and are used to produce complex shapes with high dimensional accuracy. The process is commonly used in the production of automotive parts, machinery components, and various industrial equipment.</li>

            <li><u>Extrusions</u> - a manufacturing process where a metal billet is forced through a die to create a continuous profile with a fixed cross-sectional shape. The die acts as a mold that gives the metal its desired form. The process can be hot or cold, depending on the type of material and the desired properties of the final product. Extrusions are widely used to create linear shapes with constant cross-sections, such as rods, tubes, and various profiles. Industries that commonly utilize metal extrusions include construction, transportation, and electronics.</li>
