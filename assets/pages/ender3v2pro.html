            The <a class ="regular" href="https://www.solidworks.com/">Ender-3 V2</a> is a reliable and budget-friendly 3D printer that has gained popularity among hobbyists and professionals alike. For me it was my first 3D printer and I have been surprised with its capability. With its upgraded silent mainboard and high-quality power supply, this 3D printer is capable of producing high-quality prints with minimal noise.
            <br><br>
One of the standout features of the Ender-3 V2 is its easy assembly. The printer comes partially assembled, with the remaining components easy to put together in a short amount of time. This makes it a great choice for those who are new to 3D printing and want to get started right away.
<br><br>
The printer's compact size also makes it a great choice for those with limited space. It has a small footprint, measuring just 22.8 x 22.8 x 24.7 inches, so it can easily fit on a desk or workbench. I however like to keep it under my desk.
<br><br>
The Ender-3 V2 also has a heated bed, which helps to improve the quality of prints by preventing warping and curling of the filament. It also has a build volume of 220 x 220 x 250 mm, which is more than enough for most DIY projects.
<br><br>
In terms of print quality, the Ender-3 V2 does not disappoint. It has a print resolution of up to 0.1 mm, which is more than enough for most applications. The printer also has a filament run-out sensor, which helps to prevent failed prints due to a lack of filament.
<br><br>
Overall, the Ender-3 V2 is a reliable and budget-friendly 3D printer that is suitable for both beginners and experienced users. Its easy assembly, compact size, and high-quality prints make it a great choice for those looking to get started in 3D printing.
